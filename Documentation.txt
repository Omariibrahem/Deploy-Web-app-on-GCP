Sure thing, Omar! Here's a detailed documentation file for your **Fancy Store Web App on Google Cloud Using Compute Engine**. You can save this as `DOCUMENTATION.md` or adapt it into a design doc in Eraser:

# 📘 Fancy Store Web App – Infrastructure Documentation

## 📌 Project Summary

**Fancy Store** is a scalable e-commerce web application hosted on Google Cloud, using Compute Engine virtual machines within Managed Instance Groups (MIGs). It leverages Cloud Storage for scripts/code, HTTP(S) Load Balancing with CDN, and real-time data updates via MQTT.

---

## 🧠 Design Goals

- Scalable microservice architecture (frontend & backend)
- High availability through autohealing MIGs
- Fast frontend delivery with CDN caching
- Real-time backend messaging with MQTT
- Automated VM provisioning via startup scripts
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) compatibility using Terraform or Deployment Manager

## 🧱 Infrastructure Components

### ☁️ Google Cloud Resources

| Component             | Purpose                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Compute Engine (VMs) | Hosts microservices                                        |
| Instance Templates    | Reusable VM configurations                                 |
| Managed Instance Groups | Auto-scaling and autohealing clusters                  |
| HTTP(S) Load Balancer | Routes traffic to frontend/backend services               |
| CDN                   | Caches static frontend assets                             |
| Cloud Storage         | Stores code and startup scripts                          |
| Firewall Rules        | Controls incoming traffic                                 |
| Health Checks         | Monitors instance health for load balancing               |
| MQTT Broker (Cloud IoT Core or custom VM) | Enables live data push               |

## ⚙️ Deployment Workflow

1. **Prepare startup scripts** and upload to a Cloud Storage bucket.
2. **Create instance templates** for frontend and backend using startup-script URLs.
3. **Set up Managed Instance Groups** for horizontal scalability.
4. **Configure HTTP(S) Load Balancer** with path rules:
   - `/ → Frontend`
   - `/api → Backend`
5. **Enable CDN** for caching frontend assets.
6. **Apply firewall rules** to expose ports (80/443) and restrict others.
7. **Configure MQTT service** for backend status updates and control messages.

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- ✅ Load Balancer correctly routes paths
- ✅ Autohealing MIGs recover failed instances
- ✅ MQTT messages received and handled by backend
- ✅ CDN cache performance validated using web analytics tools
- ✅ Instances boot with correct startup configuration

---

## 🛡️ Security Measures

- Limit firewall access by IP ranges and ports
- Store secrets securely in Secret Manager
- Review IAM roles for least-privilege access
- Validate input/output at backend endpoints
- Monitor using Stackdriver or Cloud Monitoring

---

## 🔁 Maintenance & Monitoring

- Stackdriver alerts on VM health and load balancer status
- Use `gcloud` or Terraform for updates
- Weekly patching via VM Manager
- Audit logs for IAM and network actions
